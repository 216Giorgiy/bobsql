These are the demos Microsoft uses at the Red Hat Summit 2018 both in our main session and at the Microsoft booth. Please let us know if you any problems or issues on my github issue site https://github.com/Microsoft/bobsql/issues

I recommend you install the following tools to use throughout these demos

- Install the SQL Server tools for RHEL at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools?view=sql-server-linux-2017#RHEL on your Linux Server
- Install mssql-cli for RHEL at https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli/blob/master/doc/installation/linux.md#red-hat-enterprise-linux-rhel-7 on your Linux Server

- Optional). If you are running Windows, install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017

For these demos, you can use any Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server. We used Virtual Machines for our demos with 8Gb of RAM and at least 100Gb of disk space (needed for the columnstore performance demo)
